# mappy-app
A frontend application where you can see nearby places in a given radius

This project is a frontend application written with Angular.It connects to mappy-api to gather the relevant nearbyplace locations, which is a springboot backend application I have created.

It requires your private google maps api key in order to work.

Functionalities:
  -Google Maps
  -Markers
  -ApiConnection
  
As a final step, project is dockerized and deployed to cloudrun.

Here is the live url that you can test it:
